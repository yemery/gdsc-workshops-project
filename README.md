## âš› Creating a React App with React Vite and Installing Dependencies

In this documentation, we'll outline the steps to create a React application using React Vite as the build tool. Additionally, we'll install and configure the following dependencies:

- Tailwind CSS
- Flowbite
- React Router DOM
- React Icons

### Step 1: Set Up React with Vite

1. Ensure that you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from here: [https://nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
2. Open your terminal or command prompt
3. Create a new React Vite project by running
    
    ```bash
    npm create vite@latest project-name -- --template react
    ```
    
4. Navigate into your project directiory and install the node modules
    
    ```bash
    cd project-name
    npm install
    ```
    

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

1. Install Tailwind CSS:
    
    ```bash
    npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
    npx tailwindcss init -p
    
    ```
    
    Configure the template paths inside the `tailwind.config.js` file:
    
    ```jsx
    module.exports = {
      content: [
        './src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
      ],
      theme: {
        extend: {},
      },
      plugins: [],
    }
    
    ```
    
    Set up the Tailwind directives inside the `./src/index.css` file:
    
    ```css
    @tailwind base;
    @tailwind components;
    @tailwind utilities;
    
    ```
    
2. Install Flowbite (optional):
    
    ```bash
    npm install flowbite flowbite-react
    
    ```
    
    Require Flowbite as a plugin inside your `tailwind.config.js` file:
    
    ```jsx
    module.exports = {
      plugins: [
        require('flowbite/plugin')
      ]
    }
    
    ```
    
    Additionally, add the Flowbite source paths to apply the classes from the interactive elements in the `tailwind.config.js` file:
    
    ```jsx
    module.exports = {
      content: [
        // ...
        'node_modules/flowbite-react/lib/esm/**/*.js'
      ]
    }
    
    ```
    
3. Install React Router DOM:
    
    ```bash
    npm install react-router-dom
    
    ```
    
4. Install React Icons:
    
    ```bash
    npm install react-icons
    
    ```
    
5. Run the app:
    
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    
    ```
